# Introduction

Welcome to My Algo Connect’s Developer Documentation. This documentation is for learning how to connect **Dapps** (Decentralized Applications) with Algorand blockchain through **[My Algo Wallet](https://wallet.myalgo.com/home)**.

## Why My Algo Connect?

My Algo Connect handles all aspects of account management. It connects users of Algorand Dapps and websites to Algorand’s blockchain technology. 
Users are allowed to manage their accounts, wallets, and keys as they prefer through **[My Algo Wallet](https://wallet.myalgo.com/home)** and abstracting that complexity from the web application to sign all kinds of transactions, all of this without the need to install any extension.


## What is My Algo Connect?

**My Algo Connect** is an SDK for DApp developers. It allows WebApp users to review and sign Algorand transactions using accounts secured within their **[My Algo Wallet](https://wallet.myalgo.com/home)**. This enables Algorand applications to use My Algo Wallet to interact with the Algorand blockchain and users to access the applications in a private and secure manner.
The integration with My Algo Wallet grants users secure access to Algorand DApps. Users only need to share their public addresses with the WebApp and this, in turn, allows them to review and sign all types of transactions ***without exposing their private keys***. The main novelty of My Algo Connect lies in the fact that all the process is managed in the user’s browser without the need for any backend service nor downloads, extensions, or browser plugins. Unlike extension-based wallets like Metamask or AlgoSigner, My Algo Connect works in any browser (including Safari) and any device giving developers a native HTML5 solution that works on all platforms.
My Algo Connect supports all Algorand transaction types, including atomic transaction groups and bulk transactions. It also supports hardware wallets like Ledger Nano S and Ledger Nano X, and it’s fully compatible with **[AlgoSDK](https://github.com/algorand/js-algorand-sdk)**. Developers can easily construct transactions in My Algo Connect in the same way they use the **[AlgoSDK](https://github.com/algorand/js-algorand-sdk)**.
